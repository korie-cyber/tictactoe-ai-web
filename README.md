A sophisticated Tic-Tac-Toe web application featuring an intelligent adaptive AI that learns from gameplay through reinforcement learning (Q-learning).

## 🎮 Features

- **Multiple AI Difficulty Levels**:
  - Easy: Random moves for beginners
  - Medium: Strategic but beatable AI
  - Hard: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
  - Adaptive: Q-learning AI that improves by playing against you

- **User Experience**:
  - Play as X (first move) or O
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Animations and visual feedback
  - Win/loss tracking statistics

- **Technical Highlights**:
  - Reinforcement learning implementation
  - Persistent AI model that remembers strategies
  - RESTful API for game state management
  - Clean separation between frontend and backend

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-tictactoe.git
cd ultimate-tictactoe

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py

# Open browser at http://localhost:5000
```

### Deployment Options

#### Render

1. Create a new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`
   - Python Version: 3.9+

#### Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The adaptive AI implements Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm:

1. Each game state is represented as a unique key
2. The AI maintains Q-values for every possible move in each state
3. During gameplay, the AI uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance:
   - **Exploration**: Trying new moves to discover better strategies
   - **Exploitation**: Using moves that have worked well previously
4. After each game, Q-values are updated based on game outcomes:
   - Wins are strongly rewarded (+1)
   - Ties receive moderate rewards (+0.5)
   - Losses are penalized (-1)

This approach allows the AI to continuously improve and adapt to your play style.
